The arguments this method requires are (1) number of rows of the grid, (2) number of columns of the grid, and (3) in which cell (counting left to right, top to bottom) create an axis. In the example above, we call `add_subplot` twice, each time we ask it to divide the figure in 2 rows and 1 column, and take the each of the axes in turn to plot sine and cosine.
