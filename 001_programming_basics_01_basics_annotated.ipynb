Some will help you to find information on that later when you need it. On the other hand, I want to teach you some practical skills, which you will be able to apply immediately to your work. In fact, I encourage you to do it as we go, and I will help you as much as I can. Then we can look together at what you did and how you did it, it will be helpful for everyone."

In here, this is a static document: you can't do anything with it, only look at it. If this is the case, you need to switch to the second way: opening this locally on your computer with an ability to run and edit code. To do this, you need to have a distribution of Python 3.5 or higher on your machine. You can get it by installing an <a href=\"https://www.continuum.io/downloads\">Anaconda distribution of Python</a> (it is a distribution which includes most of the packages we will be working with during this course).

The folder in which the Dashboard opens is the one in which your console runs by default (e.g. in Windows it is most likely `C:\\Users\\<username>`). Download this document: go to https://github.com/antopolskiy/sciprog and click green button `Clone or Download` on the right, and choose `Download ZIP`: this will download all course materials as a `ZIP` archive. Unpack the archive and put the contents in the folder where you can navigate in your Jupyter Dashboard (e.g. on Windows something like `C:\\Users\\<username>\\scientific_programming_course`). Open this notebook and follow further instructions from the local version. As you open the file, you might be asked which kernel to use: choose Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative, if you don't have the time or opportunity to install Anaconda on your computer, you can run the notebook using free service: https://try.jupyter.org/.

If you want to get more comfortable with notebooks quickly, I suggest you go through <a href=\"http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html\">notebook basics</a> section. For now what you need to know is that notebooks are composed of cells, and each cell contains either **Markdown** (like this cell), which is used for text, or **Code**, which is used for snippets of code or even whole scripts. You can execute the content of the cell by pressing **Shift+Enter**.

    "Question which almost always comes up in the Python courses: what's the deal with two different versions of Python -- Python 2 (currently in version 2.7) and Python 3 (currently in version 3.6)? Very quick note on that. Python is a quickly developing language, with new versions coming out almost every year. Usually they contain small and specific improvements, and the scripts are *forward compatible* -- whatever you could run in the previous version, you can also run in the new one. However, at some point (in 2008) it appeared that there is a stack of changes for the internal logic of the language, which need to be made for the language to develop further, and they will quite significantly change how people should use the language (significantly is a strong word: in reality it is significant for software development, not really for data science). At this point script became *forward incompatible*: you cannot (should not!) run a Python 2 script in Python 3 without any changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 2.7 is the last version of Python 2, and no new versions will come out. In fact, in 2020 support for Python 2 versions will stop completely. Python 3 is the future of the language, so definitely use that if you can. That said, there are several of packages which haven't been translated to Python 3, like `psychopy`. It is generally not a problem: you can install both versions of Python easily with Anaconda, and keep them separate. Whenever you need to use a library supported by Python 2, just switch kernel. We will learn how to do this later, in the last parts of the course (if you need it now, ask me during office hours). In any case, hopefully very soon all active packages will be transferred to Python 3.\n",

In situations when the precision requires an infinite number of repeating digits, it will fail. It is easier to understand with an analogy between fractions and decimals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about a fraction `1/3`. If you try to write it as a decimal, you'd have to write `0.33333333...` and so on. But what if you were able to only store 5 significant digits after `0.`? You'd have to write `0.33333`, that's the best approximation you can do. Now if you try to do arithmetic with `1/3`, let's say `1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 3`. However, if you try to do it in decimal where you can only store 5 significant digits, you'd get `0.99999`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar thing happens in the computers when you write any decimals (like `0.1` and `0.2`), because computers cannot store decimal notation in memory, they have to translate them to *binary*. And sometimes with this translation you get a repeating pattern, just like with `0.33333...`. But computers cannot store infinite numbers, they have to cut it after some digits. This introduces errors when working with `float`, and it will happen in any language, because it is a fundamental property of computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these difficulties, there are 2 fundamental principles one has to keep in mind when working with `float` type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**First**: Never compare equality of floats, this is exactly same mistake which we did in the script from the survey:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    x = 0.1 + 0.2\n",
    "    y = x == 0.3\n",
    "    \n",
    "The result will sometimes be `True`, sometimes `False`, based on which numbers exactly you try, but the point is that it is *inconsistent*, you cannot trust it. It is usually fine to compare which float is larger though. (**Pro-tip**: if you ever do need to compare equality of floats and cannot get around it, there is function called <a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/reference/generated/numpy.isclose.html\">`isclose`</a> in the `numpy` package, which will compare two things up to a specified tolerance).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second**: Be very careful when doing summation or difference between floats of vastly different order: the smaller ones can get lost in the noise. Consider the following example, where we add `0.001` one thousand times to a large number $10^{13}$, and expect to get $10^{13}+1$:"

The key to understand here is that when you make an operation on each element of an *array* or a *list*, each object has to be *dynamically typed*: during the execusion for each element Python core looks up at the type of the element (whether it is `int`, `float`, `string`, etc) to see which of the compiled functions to apply to the element.

However for very large arrays it can take significant time and memory will not be free for a while. To avoid this, we can use `out` to write result directly in place of our old array, without creating any new objects in memory (note that in this case `np.multiply` does not return anything, instead the result is saved as a \"by-product\" of the function). The result is equivalent in both cases. However, second implementation can lead to significant savings on preprocessing large numerical datasets."
