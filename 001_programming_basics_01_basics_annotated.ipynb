    "Question which almost always comes up in the Python courses: what's the deal with two different versions of Python -- Python 2 (currently in version 2.7) and Python 3 (currently in version 3.6)? Very quick note on that. Python is a quickly developing language, with new versions coming out almost every year. Usually they contain small and specific improvements, and the scripts are *forward compatible* -- whatever you could run in the previous version, you can also run in the new one. However, at some point (in 2008) it appeared that there is a stack of changes for the internal logic of the language, which need to be made for the language to develop further, and they will quite significantly change how people should use the language (significantly is a strong word: in reality it is significant for software development, not really for data science). At this point script became *forward incompatible*: you cannot (should not!) run a Python 2 script in Python 3 without any changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 2.7 is the last version of Python 2, and no new versions will come out. In fact, in 2020 support for Python 2 versions will stop completely. Python 3 is the future of the language, so definitely use that if you can. That said, there are several of packages which haven't been translated to Python 3, like `psychopy`. It is generally not a problem: you can install both versions of Python easily with Anaconda, and keep them separate. Whenever you need to use a library supported by Python 2, just switch kernel. We will learn how to do this later, in the last parts of the course (if you need it now, ask me during office hours). In any case, hopefully very soon all active packages will be transferred to Python 3.\n",

    "As you can see, there is a marginal error in the end. Why is it there? The answer has to do with how numbers (in particular, `float` type) are stored in memory: they can only store a certain number of *significant digits*. In situations when the precision requires an infinite number of repeating digits, it will fail. It is easier to understand with an analogy between fractions and decimals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about a fraction `1/3`. If you try to write it as a decimal, you'd have to write `0.33333333...` and so on. But what if you were able to only store 5 significant digits after `0.`? You'd have to write `0.33333`, that's the best approximation you can do. Now if you try to do arithmetic with `1/3`, let's say `1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 3`. However, if you try to do it in decimal where you can only store 5 significant digits, you'd get `0.99999`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar thing happens in the computers when you write any decimals (like `0.1` and `0.2`), because computers cannot store decimal notation in memory, they have to translate them to *binary*. And sometimes with this translation you get a repeating pattern, just like with `0.33333...`. But computers cannot store infinite numbers, they have to cut it after some digits. This introduces errors when working with `float`, and it will happen in any language, because it is a fundamental property of computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these difficulties, there are 2 fundamental principles one has to keep in mind when working with `float` type.\n",

    "    y = x == 0.3\n",
    "    \n",
    "The result will sometimes be `True`, sometimes `False`, based on which numbers exactly you try, but the point is that it is *inconsistent*, you cannot trust it. It is usually fine to compare which float is larger though. (**Pro-tip**: if you ever do need to compare equality of floats and cannot get around it, there is function called <a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/reference/generated/numpy.isclose.html\">`isclose`</a> in the `numpy` package, which will compare two things up to a specified tolerance).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second**: Be very careful when doing summation or difference between floats of vastly different order: the smaller ones can get lost in the noise. Consider the following example, where we add `0.001` one thousand times to a large number $10^{13}$, and expect to get $10^{13}+1$:"
